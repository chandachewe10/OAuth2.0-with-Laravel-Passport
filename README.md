This application is made in helping developers in Issuing Access Tokens 
(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, AUTHORISATION_CODE AND BEARER TOKEN) to third applications 
using OAuth2.0 In Laravel Passport. 
Using OAuth2 with authorization codes is how most developers are familiar with OAuth2. 

# Installation

2. `composer update`
3. `php artisan key:generate`
4. Create .env file and put `LOCALHOST=` on bottom if not present

# Use Case
1. Create the Database name in `.env` and Run the migrations `php artisan migrate` 
2. In your `.env` file put your base url on `LOCALHOST`. E.g 
if your application is located in htdocs then your base url will be
`http://localhost/OAuth2.0-with-Laravel-Passport/public`.
3. Do the registration with the register url as usual and you are good to go to the dashboard.
4. The dashboard is user friendly you can check were you can create an app, view the app you created
and creating the token. 
5. To create the token expand the side bar Menu and click `Application` and select the feature on drop down.
6. To view the created token click `Applications` on top, and select the feature on dropdown.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
